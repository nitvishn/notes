<blockquote>
<p>After I no longer speak they break our fingers<br>
to salvage my wedding ring. Rebecca Rachel Ruth<br>
Aaron Emmanuel David, stars on all our brows<br>
beneath the gaze of men with guns. Mourn for the daughters,</p>
<p>upright as statues, brave. You would not look at me.<br>
You waited for the bullet. Fell. I say, Remember.<br>
Remember these appalling days which make the world<br>
Forever bad. One saw I was alive. Loosened</p>
<p>his belt. My bowels opened in a ragged gape of fear.<br>
Between the gap of corpses I could see a child.<br>
The soldiers laughed. Only a matter of days separate<br>
this from acts of torture now. They shot her in the eye.</p>
<p>How would you prepare to die, on a perfect April evening<br>
with young men gossiping and smoking by the graves?<br>
My bare feet felt the earth and urine trickled<br>
Down my legs until I heard the click. Not yet. A trick.</p>
<p>After immense suffering someone takes tea on the lawn.<br>
After the terrible moans a boy washes his uniform.<br>
After the history lesson children run to their toys the world<br>
turns in its sleep the spades shovel soil Sara Ezra …</p>
<p>Sister, if seas part us, do you not consider me?<br>
Tell them I sang the ancient psalms at dusk<br>
inside the wire and strong men wept. Turn thee<br>
unto me with mercy, for I am desolate and lost.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Objectifying the people as resources that are salvaged</li>
<li>Dehumanises the guards</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Aaron Emmanuel David, stars on all our brows</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The names are just listed; permeates a feeling that these people don’t have identities</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>beneath the gaze of men with guns. Mourn for the daughters,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Girls carried the family name forward in Jewish communities</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>upright as statues, brave. You would not look at me.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shows self-respect, human dignity</li>
<li>Looking at each other would induce more emotional pain</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You waited for the bullet. Fell. I say, Remember.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>They feel that death is preferable to this situation</li>
<li>Varied sentence structure using caesura raises the impact of “Fell”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember these appalling days which make the world<br>
Forever bad. One saw I was alive. Loosened</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Addresses the permanence of Holocaust</li>
<li>It cannot be undone</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>his belt. My bowels opened in a ragged gape of fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Does not give complete details, leaves reader to imagine horrors</li>
<li>Choice of words creates strong effect:
<ul>
<li>‘ragged’ - rough, visceral</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Between the gap of corpses I could see a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>She is trying to suppress her emotions -&gt; shows that she has been desensitized to suffering.</li>
<li>Matter-of-fact language.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The soldiers laughed. Only a matter of days separate</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>‘laughing’ of the soldiers shows their inhumanity</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>this from acts of torture now. They shot her in the eye.<br>
* Shifts in time - describes past incident from memory, says that this was days ago from ‘now’, and goes back into the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shots through the eye aren’t always lethal; they are trying to prolong her pain</li>
<li>Takes marksmanship to shoot someone in the eye -&gt; shows supremacy of the soldiers’ ability</li>
<li>Destroying her vision
<ul>
<li>Destroying all future prospects for the child</li>
<li>Destroying her window into the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shows the mercilessness of the soldiers</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>How would you prepare to die, on a perfect April evening</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>April is symbolic of life and rebirth - beginning of spring</li>
<li>Second person pronoun, communicating how impossible it is to prepare to die in this situation</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>with young men gossiping and smoking by the graves?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No regard for human life</li>
<li>Indoctrination of the nazi guards: they are doing this to appease their Nazi leaders</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>My bare feet felt the earth and urine trickled</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Very realistic and uncensored</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Down my legs until I heard the click. Not yet. A trick.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The rhythmic quality suggests repetitiveness</li>
<li>Rhyme suggests that the soldiers find this amusing and view it as a game</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>After immense suffering someone takes tea on the lawn.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Extreme contrast</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>After the terrible moans a boy washes his uniform.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The boy is a guard</li>
<li>Refers to him as a ‘boy’ rather than a ‘man’ or a ‘soldier’:
<ul>
<li>He has been brought up in this violent environment, violence is all these people and children know</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the murder even affect them?
<ul>
<li>There is no visible psychological effect of all of this violence on the soldiers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>After the history lesson children run to their toys the world</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Anaphora - ‘after’</li>
<li>Children are unaffected by the knowledge of this</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>turns in its sleep the spades shovel soil Sara Ezra …</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shovel soil - connotations to bodies being buried</li>
<li>Sibilance and ellipses show continuity</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Sister, if seas part us, do you not consider me?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Speaking to the rest of society, asking them why they are indifferent to her condition</li>
<li>Almost speaking to the reader</li>
<li>“Sister” shows feeling of oneness</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell them I sang the ancient psalms at dusk<br>
inside the wire and strong men wept. Turn thee<br>
unto me with mercy, for I am desolate and lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bibilical allusion</li>
<li>Striking, direct end</li>
<li>Ends with depressing tone</li>
</ul>
