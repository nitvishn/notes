<p>This is a nostalgic poem which begins by describing lovely, simple experiences of her last year at Primary School, and builds towards a rather disturbing, complex conclusion when that innocent world of childhood is left behind at the end of the final summer term. Mrs Tilscher is a real person who taught Duffy in her last year at primary school.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could travel up the Blue Nile…Tana. Ethopia. Khartoum. Aswan</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>exotic, enchanting places which are visited, in the class’s imagination, in a Geography lesson. The use of  you makes it more informal and does not restrict the experience only to the poet herself.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>a skittle of milk</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>delightful assonance to describe the free milk at playtime.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>chalky pyramids rubbed to dust</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the ritual of cleaning the previous lesson off the blackboard, but also an adult ironic reflection on the crumbling ancient ruins.</li>
</ul>
<p>The past is nostalgically invoked with the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>long pole<br>
for the windows, which has long since vanished from modern schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the laugh of a bell</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>an original, cheerful metaphor used to invoke SOUND.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This was better than home.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A plain, emphatic statement which may be hard to believe for some of you; she obviously loved school – and for many working class children in the 1960’s, it was a better place to be.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Enthralling books</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>she seems to have been captivated by learning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>glowed like a sweet shop</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a simile using the idea of something which has great appeal to children: Duffy conveys a sense of excitement throughout.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sugar paper. Coloured shapes</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>beautiful images of SIGHT.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Brady and Hindley…</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the horrors of life outside the classroom, suggested by these notorious child murderers, could happily be erased in school.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Tilscher loved you</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Another short, emphatic statement. The teacher is contrasted to the potential abusers outside school.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The scent of a pencil</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>an attractive image of SMELL.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>a xylophone’s nonsense</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>another happy, appealing image SOUND. Not formal music – but fun.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the Easter term</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>time moves forward quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The children are growing up, reflected by the images of the frogs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>freed</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>another charming image of fun – causes excitement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>away from the lunch queue</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>children not keeping to the rules; breaking free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sexual awakening at the end of the stanza.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feverish July</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>images of heat / sex: the child is going through puberty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Tilscher smiled, then turned away</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>to avoid answering awkward questions about sex. Primary school can’t give the answers any longer; children have outgrown it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class is leaving primary school - when the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reports were handed out</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>childhood has officially ended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The breaking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>thunderstorm</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>is an apt metaphor for adolescence - a deluge of feelings, hormones and changed attitudes.</li>
</ul>
