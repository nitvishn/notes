<blockquote>
<p>In his dark room he is finally alone<br>
with spools of suffering set out in ordered rows.<br>
The only light is red and softly glows,<br>
as though this were a church and he<br>
a priest preparing to intone a Mass.<br>
Belfast. Beirut. Phnom Penh. All flesh is grass.</p>
<p>He has a job to do. Solutions slop in trays<br>
beneath his hands, which did not tremble then<br>
though seem to now. Rural England. Home again<br>
to ordinary pain which simple weather can dispel,<br>
to fields which don’t explode beneath the feet<br>
of running children in a nightmare heat.</p>
<p>Something is happening. A stranger’s features<br>
faintly start to twist before his eyes,<br>
a half-formed ghost. He remembers the cries<br>
of this man’s wife, how he sought approval<br>
without words to do what someone must<br>
and how the blood stained into foreign dust.</p>
<p>A hundred agonies in black and white &gt;<br>
from which his editor will pick out five or six<br>
for Sunday’s supplement. The reader’s eyeballs prick<br>
with tears between the bath and pre-lunch beers.<br>
From the aeroplane he stares impassively at where<br>
he earns his living and they do not care.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In his dark room he is finally alone</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This could possibly signify the fact that he is alone with his dark thoughts, and has no one in the world to share them with.</li>
<li>Tone of reflection - he is finally home; gets time to be with himself.
<ul>
<li>Finds solace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>with spools of suffering set out in ordered rows.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Contrast spools of suffering with ordered rows</li>
<li>There is a distinction between the chaos of war and the ordered nature of the photographs.</li>
<li>‘ordered rows’ could relate to:
<ul>
<li>military formation</li>
<li>mass at church</li>
<li>graves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The only light is red and softly glows,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Establish setting</li>
<li>‘red’ represents violence and blood, a reminder of the brutal nature of war</li>
<li>the soft glow contrasts with the intensity of war</li>
<li>Creates a sombre atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>as though this were a church and he</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>churches are quiet places of reflection; same atmosphere as this room</li>
<li>a place to atone for sins</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>a priest preparing to intone a Mass.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Religious imagery</li>
<li>the photographer is spreading his knowledge about war to the public via the photos, just like a priest conducting a Mass</li>
<li>Honouring the sacrifice of the soldiers (just like Jesus is honoured in a Mass)</li>
<li>War is against everything that religion preaches - establishes irony</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Belfast. Beirut. Phnom Penh. All flesh is grass.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>‘all flesh is grass’ is allusion to the Bible
<ul>
<li>emphasises the transitory nature of life</li>
<li>all life withers and decomposes into grass</li>
<li>War makes human flesh as disposable as grass</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Declarative; mentions all the places war-affected</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>He has a job to do. Solutions slop in trays</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>responsibility</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>beneath his hands, which did not tremble then</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Post-traumatic stress disorder</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>though seem to now. Rural England. Home again</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feels safe and at home at England</li>
<li>The horrors of war seem to only strike him now when he’s back in England</li>
<li>Caesurae show the change in atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>to ordinary pain which simple weather can dispel,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Highlights the insignificance of the problems of the people in England</li>
<li>easily dispelled</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>to fields which don’t explode beneath the feet<br>
of running children in a nightmare heat.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Heavy contrast between life in England and the war zone.
<ul>
<li>Intensity vs calmness of everyday life
<ul>
<li>(“ordinary” and “simple”) vs (“explode” and “running children”)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simple weather vs nightmare heat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Loss of innocent lives - evokes pathos.</li>
<li>Compares the whole experience of war to a nightmare</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Something is happening. A stranger’s features</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shift in tone</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>faintly start to twist before his eyes,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>enjambment gives an idea of the picture being developed</li>
<li>twist - morbid image of the man’s face’s shape</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>a half-formed ghost. He remembers the cries</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Image is developing</li>
<li>Ghost because the man is now given life through the photograph; living after death</li>
<li>Translucent nature of the man’s face</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>of this man’s wife, how he sought approval<br>
without words to do what someone must</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imperative responsibility</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>and how the blood stained into foreign dust.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>‘stained’ - shows permanence of the effects of war</li>
<li>‘foreign’ - unfamiliar</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>A hundred agonies in black and white</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the pain is captured in the limited, two-dimensional medium of a photo</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>from which his editor will pick out five or six<br>
for Sunday’s supplement. The reader’s eyeballs prick<br>
with tears between the bath and pre-lunch beers.<br>
From the aeroplane he stares impassively at where<br>
he earns his living and they do not care.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emphasises the indifference of the general public regarding war</li>
</ul>
