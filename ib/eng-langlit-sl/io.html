<ul>
<li>
<p>You can choose any from among these:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Namesake</li>
<li>Poems by Carol Ann Duffy</li>
<li>Persepolis (HL)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must not choose the same text as anyone in your class and you    cannot plan with another person to choose the same text and say the    same points (collusion).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intertextuality</strong>: reading, comparing and seeing the essence of other texts in the one you are reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IO will test your abilities in understanding the Areas of    Exploration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IO counts for 20% (HL)/30% (SL) of your exam grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will analyse a text based on context of composition and context of reception, what are the individual elements, see the text through one line of inquiry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-the-io-work">How does the IO work?</h3>
<p>You will choose 40 lines of one literary text and compare it with a NLBT (non-literary body of text).</p>
<h3 id="lines-of-inquiry">Lines of Inquiry</h3>
<p><strong>Fields of Enquiry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Culture, identity, community</li>
<li>Belief, value, education</li>
<li>Politics, power, justice</li>
<li>Art, creativity, imagination</li>
<li>Science, tech, natural world</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose a LB and an NLBW that can be extremely closely related. The more closely related, the more gruesome, the better. Choose Texts with impactful scenes and vocabulary in order to enhance the analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through an AoE, find a way to link together the two texts. Start off with a general issue, like “Racial Discrimination” or “Horrors of War” and then explore it in detail through either a lens, or narrowing down the issue so that it is a) global and b) closely associated with both texts. Attempt to use flowery vocabulary to design your Question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make notes on the aspects of the two texts that are relevant to the texts. For poems, that is give probably, structure and form, and plot and devices, along with your short analysis directly linked to the RQ. In a similar way, for the NLBW, for a photograph, use lighting, colour, exposure, scene, setting, context, etc. In any case, focus for 30s on the plot, that’s super important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structure your IO as: Introduction &gt; Plot of LB &gt; Analysis of LB &gt; Transition &gt; NLBW Plot &gt; NLBW Analysis &gt; Linking together &gt; Conclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice it continuously, it helps!</p>
