<h4 id="loftus-and-palmer-1974">Loftus and Palmer (1974):</h4>
<h5 id="aim">Aim</h5>
<ul>
<li>To test their hypothesis that the language used in eye witness testimony can alter memory</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="experiment-one">Experiment One</h5>
<h5 id="procedure">Procedure</h5>
<ul>
<li>Forty five American students formed and Opportunity sample</li>
<li>7 files of traffic accidents, ranging in duration from 5 to 30 seconds were presented in a random order to each group.</li>
<li>Participants were asked to describe what happened as if they were eyewitness.</li>
<li>They were asked how fast the cars were going when they <strong>(smashed/collided/bumped/hit/contacted)</strong> each other.</li>
<li><em>Note: IV was the wording of the question, DV was the speed reported by participants</em></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="results">Results</h5>
<ul>
<li>The estimated speed was affected by the verb used.</li>
</ul>

</table><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<ul>
<li>The results show that the verb conveyed an impression of the speed the car was travelling and this altered the participants’ perceptions. In other words, eyewitness testimony might be biased by the way questions are asked after a crime is committed.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="experiment-two">Experiment Two</h5>
<h5 id="procedure-1">Procedure</h5>
<ul>
<li>150 Students were shown a one minute film which showed a car driving followed by four seconds of multiple traffic accidents.</li>
<li>100 students were asked <em>“how fast were the car going when they <strong>hit</strong> each other?”</em> or <em>“how fast were the car going when they <strong>smashed</strong> each other?”</em></li>
<li>Remaining 50 weren’t asked anything.</li>
<li>One week later they were asked if they saw broken glass</li>

</table><h5 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h5>
<ul>
<li>This research suggests that memory is easily distorted by questioning technique and information acquired after the event can merge with original memory causing inaccurate recall or reconstructive memory.</li>
<li>The results from experiment two suggest that this effect is not just due to a response-bias because leading questions actually altered the memory a participant had for the event.</li>

<h5 id="aim-1">Aim</h5>
<ul>
<li>To investigate how verbal information supplied after an event influences a witness’s visual memory for that event.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="procedure-2">Procedure</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participants shown a series of 30 color slides depicting successive stages in a car–pedestrian accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half were shown a red Datsun travelling along a side street toward an intersection with a stop sign and the other, a yield sign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They then answered a series of 20 questions, one of which was either “Did another car pass the red Datsun while it was stopped at the <em>stop sign</em>?” OR “<em>yield sign</em>”</p>
</li>
</ul>

</table><h5 id="results-2">Results</h5>
<ul>
<li>Subjects who received misleading post-event information were able to correctly recognize the slide actually seen in 41% of the cases, while those who received consistent post-event information made a correct choice in 75% of the cases.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Misleading post-event verbal information was integrated with visual information from before, which resulted in reconstructive memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more time passes from the moment of the original event, the stronger effect misleading information has on our visual memory.</p>

<h5 id="aim-2">Aim</h5>
<ul>
<li>To determine if false memories of autobiographical events can be created through the power of suggestion.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="procedure-3">Procedure</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parent/sibling of participant was first contacted and asked 2 questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Could you retell childhood memories of the participant?” AND “Do you remember a time when the participant was lost in a mall?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants asked to write about 4 memories in a questionnaire sent by mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 events were real while 1 was “getting lost in the mall”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were then interviewed twice over 4 weeks, asked to recall as much information as they could about the events and rate their levels of confidence on a scale of 1-10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the second one, they were debriefed, asked to guess which memory was the false one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="results-3">Results</h5>
<ul>
<li>About 25% of the participants “recalled” the false memory. However, they also ranked this memory as less confident than the other memories they wrote less about the memory on their questionnaire</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="conclusion-3">Conclusion</h5>
<ul>
<li>Some people can be misled into believing a false event happened to them in their childhood through suggestion that it was a true event. Therefore, it is possible for memories to be altered by suggestion.</li>
