<h2 id="system-1-and-2-of-thinking">System 1 and 2 of thinking</h2>
<p>Kahneman proposed the theory of system 1 and 2 of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>System 1</strong> of thinking is</p>
<ul>
<li>fast</li>
<li>-context dependent</li>
<li>intuitive</li>
<li>emotional</li>
<li>effortless</li>
<li>impulsive</li>
<li>employs heuristics</li>
<li>based on past experiences<br>
<em><strong>Heuristics  -</strong></em><br>
Are mental shortcuts and simplified strategies that people use to make decisions. This theory can be also described as a set of rules, and therefore can be <strong>used to predict people’s behaviour.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Heuristics lead to <strong>cognitive bias</strong>.  So system 1 of thinking leads to <strong>cognitive bias</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>System 2</strong> is said to have evolved after the development of language and it is</p>
<ul>
<li>slow</li>
<li>logical</li>
<li>abstract (reasoning)</li>
<li>conscious and demands effort</li>
<li>rational</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Intuitive thinking leads to biases and 3 of them are</p>
<ul>
<li>tendency to focus on limited information</li>
<li>tendency to look for information that conforms pre-existing beliefs.</li>
<li>tendency to avoid holding inconsisten information</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Kahneman and Tversky’s study Hospital study that shows an example of how people employ heuristics to come to conclusions.<br>
They were asked the following question.<br>
<em>The probability that a boy is born at any given point of time is 50%. Given that 15 babies are born in a small hospital per day and 45 babies are born in the larger hospital everyday, which hospital was more likely to record more days where the number of boys born is more than 60%</em><br>
<em>A. Larger hospital</em><br>
<em>B. Smaller hospital</em><br>
<em>C. Roughly the same</em></p>
<p>Results: 78% of the participants picked option C because of the 50% representative heuristic given in the beginning of the question. The correct answer would be option B - smaller hospital, because in a larger hospital has a larger sample size and is less likely to have disproportionate day.<br>
The participants were using <strong>representative heuristic</strong><br>
<strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
This study demonstrates how using one system of thinking can influence our decisions.<br>
It is a simple demonstration, but it fails to explain how people would react if they had consequences.</p>
<p>Other studies that you can use to explain cognitive bias:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wason’s four card problem - Confirmation Bias</li>
<li>Tschirgi’s cake making experiment - congruence bias</li>
<li>Leon Festinger’s covert observation of a cult - cognitive dissonance</li>
<li>Freedman and Fraser’s safe driving petition experiment - cognitive dissonance</li>
</ul>
<p>Conformation Bias is the tendency to seek information that confirms pre-existing beliefs</p>
<p>Congruence Bias is the tendency to seek out positive information rather than useful information.</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance - Inconsistency (dissonance) in thought or action can cause stress, so people tend to either change their behaviour or their beliefs.</p>
